                    <h1>research</h1>
                    <p>The fundamental driving force of science is the discovery of latent structure that converts myriad disparate data  into understanding. In the 21st century, the growth of data acquisition has greatly outpaced the growth of data analysis, rendering current computational and statistical tools insufficient for extracting meaning from large datasets. Neuroscience is particularly susceptible to these big data challenges, as neuroexperimentalists have devised methods of collecting terabytes of data per hour. Without statistical and computational frameworks for analysis and organization of these data, the field will be unable to fully reap the benefits of this enormous potential. Our expertise in (i)  computer science, (ii) data curation, (iii) statistical science, and (iv) neuroscience  enables us to fill this gap. Below we elaborate on these four threads.
                    </p>


                    <h3>computer science</h3>

                    <p>Statistical methods require computational implementations. Moreover, the raw data of the 21st century is not typically in a form immediately amenable to statistical analysis; rather, various data wrangling/munging/pre-processing is typically beneficial.   We therefore develop computational tools to enable principled statistical inference on such data.  This includes:

                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>petascale data management</strong> including <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/open-connectome"><em>spatial databases</em></a> for 3D+ (multispectral or time-series) image data including voxel-wise metadata, and  <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/m2g"><em>grute databases</em></a>  for populations of massive graphs with rich attributes, as well as MATLAB and Python APIs, a content distribution system, LIMS, and hardware configuration;</li> 

                            <li><strong>interactive visualizations</strong> including for multispectral annotated 3D+ big <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/NeuroDataViz">images</a>, <a href="http://gx.neurodata.io">graphs</a>, and <a href="http://vx.neurodata.io">vectors</a>.</li>

                            <li><strong>streaming image processing</strong> including both <a href="https://github.com/mkazhdan/DMG">2D stitching artifact correction</a>  and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/GradientDomainFusion/Version1.0/">3D</a>  histogram normalization;</li>

                            <li><strong>distributed computer vision</strong> including graph inference from <a href="http://i2g.io/">serial electron microscopy</a>, calcium imaging,  <a href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/">functional magnetic resonance imaging</a>, <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/ndmg">diffusion tensor imaging</a> , and object detection in both <a href="http://docs.neurodata.io/vesicle/">MATLAB</a> and <a href="http://docs.neurodata.io/nddocs/#parse">Python</a>;</li>

                            <li><strong>scalable machine learning libraries</strong> (<a href="http://flashx.io">FlashX</a>) including FlashGraph for billion vertex graph analytics using various graph traversal algorithms, FlashMatrix for matrix applications such as svd, pca, k-means, and linear classification, and FlashR for usability;  </li>



                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="data">data curation</h3>

                    <p>To answer any of the below questions, using any of the above statistical methods and computational tools, fundamentally requires data.  Much like all of our code is open source, all of our data is open access.  Moreover, we provide it in a fashion immediately amenable to analysis for everyone, including the below data types:

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>images</strong> both anatomical including electron microscopy, array tomography, expansion microscopy, x-ray microscopy, CLARITY, histology, as well as  physiological images such as calcium imaging, massively parallel electrophysiology, and multi-modal mri;</li>

                            <li><strong>annotations</strong> including volumetric annotations, skeletonizations, and ROIs;</li>

                            <li><strong><u>g</u>raphs</strong> with <u>r</u>ich attrib<u>ute</u>s ("<em>grutes</em>") derived from a wide variety of experimental techniques and scales.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>                    

                    <h2>statistical science</h2>

                    <p>Statistical sciences have developed a beautiful corpus of knowledge on inference in various settings over the last 100 years.  However, in recent years, new experimental and data collection methods have yielded datasets that no longer fit within the assumptions upon which that body of literature rests.  We therefore  focus  on building statistical methods for 21st century data, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>time-series</strong> 
                                <a href="https://github.com/jovo/smc-oopsi">sequential monte carlo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jovo/oopsi">non-negative deconovlution</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jovo/spike-sorting">dictionary learning</a>, <a href="https://github.com/decarlson/opass">variational inference</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/shachen/PLDS"> high-dimensional system identification</a>;</li>
                                <li><strong>graphs</strong> inference of graphs, supervised and unsupervised vertex clustering, similarity and dissimilarity metrics, graph matching, and population theory including graph classification and joint embedding;</li>

                                <li><strong>shapes</strong> <a href="https://github.com/mkazhdan/ShapeSPH">non-parametric shape descriptors</a> and  <a href="http://cis.jhu.edu/software/">nonlinear diffeomorphisms</a> for statistical analysis of big shapes;</li>


                                <li><strong>vectors</strong> high-dimensional <a href="https://github.com/jovo/LOL">linear</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ttomita/RandomerForest">non-linear classification</a>, optimal design, signal detection, <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2013/Schedule?q=vogelstein">density estimation</a>,  and dependence discovery.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h3>neuroscience</h3>

                        <p>The above described tools, both statistical and computational, are designed and built in the service of answering fundamental questions in neuroscience, both basic and clinical.  Below are the projects we are have worked on, and continue to develop:

                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>anatomy</strong> including em connectomics, synaptomics, and mesoscale neuro-architecture; </li>

                              <li><strong>physiology</strong> including analysis of correlations from o-phys data;</li>

                              <li><strong>systems</strong> including <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095753">biomarker discovery</a> from multimodal mri data, and <a href="http://classic.sciencemag.org/content/344/6182/386.abstract">behavioromics</a>;</li>

                              <li><strong>connectome coding</strong> is homologous to neural coding, where we learn the rules by which memories & experiences are stored in patterns of connectivity, rather than patterns of activity.</li>
                          </ul>
                      </p>
