# Tutorials

## How do I look at images and annotations?


### OCPViz

#### Viewing a project

#### Adding layers

#### Changing the colors of layers

#### Example projects

- http://brainviz1.cs.jhu.edu/ocp/viz/project/kharris15apical/
- http://openconnecto.me/ocp/viz/project/kasthuri15ramon/

### Graph explorer

### MROCP 

#### Description and Access

#### Load graphs in gephi

## How do I look at Graphs?

- web viewer: graph explorer
- local client viewers: gephi



## Download some data to play with on my computer?

### Images

- web-form < 2 GB
- CAJAL < 1 TB
- ndio < 1 TB
- get: arbitrary size

### Graphs

## Show some image data to labmates/colleagues?

- web-form < 200 GB
- CAJAL < 1 TB
- ndio < 1 TB
- auto-ingest < 2 TB https://github.com/openconnectome/open-connectome/blob/master/ingest/autoingest/verifyjson.py
- (s)ftp/(s)http/open-s3: abritrary size https://github.com/openconnectome/open-connectome/tree/master/ingest/

## Stitch and align into volume?

## Color correct a volume?

- 2D
- 3D

# Computer Vision

## Manually annotate some data?

- CATMAID
- knossos
- VAST
- Reconstruct
- ITK-SNAP
â€¦.

## Share annotations (RAMONify)?

csv ingest script (with spec)

## Proofread and error correct metadata?

- ocpviz: edit metadata
- parity

## Train my machine vision algorithm on some data?

Training paradigms are different for each use-case.  We provide examples for a random forest training example and a paradigm using ilastik.  Training is typically conducted using standalone functions (v. a distributed LONI approach)

- vesicle RF example
- ilastik example

## Assess the performance of algorithms?

example (in matlab), of making ROC curves on held out data from a separate volume
example in loni sweeping over a set of hyperparameters

## Run my machine vision algorithm at scale?
LONI stuff

# Analysis

## Query the scene?

- CAJAL
- ndio

## Estimate statistical properties?

## Third Party Tools Integration Status

- ITK Snap:  Works in manno for annotation purposes.  No one has written a tutorial about actually visualizing things otherwise, but should be possible
- bigdataviewer:  Broke when we switched to channel interface.  Stephan is fixing.
catmaid:  [ask alex]
- vaa3d:  Nathan and Dean did this.  Code broke when we switched to channel interface.
- knossos:  Kunal wrote a backend so that they could pull data.  Status unknown.  No import capability.
- viking:   Kunal wrote a backend so that they could pull data.  Status unknown.  No import capability.
- neutube:  none yet
- janelia-workstation:  ??
- reconstruct:  Alex has some scripts.
- VAST:  can pull data from neurodata
