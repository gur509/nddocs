# Big Data Ninja for Terascale Neuro Images & Graphs

*The Organization*: NeuroData (http://neurodata.io) is a team of data scientists at Johns Hopkins Univeristy's Biomedical Engineering Department - the world's premiere BME Department - building and applying state-of-the-art machine learning tools to solve the most pressing contemporary problems in the best big neuroscience datasets. 

*The Role*: You will be the Lead Data Scientist, responsible for analyzing our collections of big data and contributing to writing papers on the results.  All experiments and analyses will be designed together with our highly esteemed faculty members. All analyses will be open source, and typicaly on open access data. Data will include teravoxel images, teravertex graphs, and terafeature tables.

*The Requirements*: Strong data scientific skills, including foundational knowledge of statistics, machine learning, and numerical programming.   In particular, essentially all code we write will be in R or Python. Each day faculty will analyze results from previous day, and decide on next steps to implement. Your physical presence will be expected for a few hours each day. 

*The Preferences*: A graduate degree in a relevant field (e.g., computer science, math, physics, statistics) is essentially required.

*The Logistics*: Job is full-time, located in Baltimore, MD, salary commensurate with background training, benefits include health care and other stuff, including access to the best hospital in the world. Your office will be located in the Center for Imaging Science (http://cis.jhu.edu) in Clark Hall, at the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins Univeristy, which is currently undergoing a beautiful multimillion dollar renovation.

*To Apply*: Send the following info to jv.work@jhu.edu:

- CV/Resume
- A link to your github repo (or other public repo; if you do not have such a link, please email some code project examples)
- Graduate school transcript
- Names/email of 2 people that can provide excellent recommendations in a timely fashion
