**ndio** is a Python 2 and 3 package that enables big-data neuroscience, as well
as directly interfacing with NeuroData workflows and servers.  It is extensible
to work with other remotes (servers) to allow for additional flexibility.  More
complete documentation is available at [the ndio documentation
website](<http://docs.neurodata.io/ndio>).

 

ndio is now considered stable as of the 1.0 release in April 2016.
