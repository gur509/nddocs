## Atlases
When deriving MR connectomes, we parcellate the brain into groups of nodes as defined by anatomical atlases. These atlases are defined either physiologically or structurally by neuroanatomists (Desikan, Talairach, AAL, JHU, HarvardOxford), are generated using a segmentation algorithm looking for certain features or groupings (CPAC200, slab1068, slab907), or are images of the brain which have been cubed-up by our own brain-downsampling code (Incremented, DS). Tabulated below are the atlases we use and the number of regions (i.e. graph nodes) there are in them, respectively.

All of the atlases are stored as Nifti images, and can those from external sources can be found [here](http://openconnecto.me/data/public/MR/atlases/parcellations/ingested/), and our generated downsampled atlases can be found [here](http://openconnecto.me/data/public/MR/atlases/downsample/).
