"""
FSL's linear registration tool for aligning multimodal MRI images.

The linear registration tool in FSL, FLIRT, allows us to both compute and apply registration transforms between image spaces. This tool uses affine registration, and is implemented here to transform DTI data into structural MPRAGE space, as well as the MPRAGE image into standard MNI space.

FSL's FLIRT documentation: http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT

**Positional Arguments**

		Input image: [.nii; nifti image]
				- The 3D image which is to be transformed.
		Reference image: [.nii; nifti image]
				- The 3D image which will be the target of the transformation.

**Returns**

		Output image: [.nii; nifti image]
				- The name of the output image, which is the input image aligned to the reference image space.

**Optional Arguments**

		Search range: [2x float] (default = -180 180)
				- Orientation angles to search when aligning images.
		Transform matrix: [.xfm, .mat; binary file] 
				- Using different flags, this can be either an input or an output parameter which maps the input image without recomputing the transform, or stores the transform, respectively.
